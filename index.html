                <h2>Designing for Human-Powered Interaction in Sustainable Energy Generation</h2>
                <p>This masterâ€™s thesis project focused on designing human-powered interaction systems to generate energy through everyday activities, exploring how users engage with and perceive these systems within the context of their daily routines. The core design challenge was integrating physical effort into modern lifestyles in a way that balanced user engagement with convenience and comfort.</p>

                <h2>Dancing in the Midnight</h2>
                <p>Dancing in the Midnight is an interactive design project that envisions a future where renewable energy plays a central role in everyday life. Our goal was to harness kinetic energy from human movement to power all the electricity needed at a playground. We designed a miniature dance floor that reacts to the presence of people, with dynamic lighting and audio that change as users step on the tiles, creating an engaging, collaborative experience that becomes more vibrant with each participant.</p>
