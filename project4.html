                    <p>Cleo is an interactive system designed to serve as a personalized cooking mentor, guiding users through the learning-to-cook process and enhancing their overall cooking experience. The system offers real-time, hands-on assistance, making cooking more intuitive and enjoyable, especially for beginners.<p>
                    <p>The project resulted in Cleo, a 3D-printed virtual cooking assistant with responsive light feedback. The assistant provided visual cues to guide users through cooking steps, offering a blend of physical interaction and digital support. The technical setup included an Arduino and breadboard for wiring and light control, ensuring a seamless, interactive experience.<p>
                    <p>Our design process focused on the user, utilizing a range of tools and methods to create an engaging system. We used Affinity Diagrams to organize insights and identify key user needs. Personas and Empathy Maps were created to build user profiles and understand emotional responses, helping us gain a deeper understanding of user behavior. To refine the guidance system, we developed and tested sample interactions through different scenarios.<p>
