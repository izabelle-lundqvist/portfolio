                    <p>Dancing in the Midnight is an interactive design project that envisions a future where renewable energy plays a central role in everyday life. Our goal was to harness kinetic energy from human movement to power all the electricity needed at a playground. We designed a miniature dance floor that reacts to the presence of people, with dynamic lighting and audio that change as users step on the tiles, creating an engaging, collaborative experience that becomes more vibrant with each participant.<p>
                    <p>The project progressed through three phases of prototyping, evolving from low-fidelity models to a functional high-fidelity prototype. We integrated various materials and technologies, including a breadboard with connected wiring, responsive lighting components, and custom-built wooden structures. Our usability testing refined the design to ensure it was both intuitive and captivating for users, culminating in a scaled demonstration that successfully conveyed the potential of sustainable, movement-driven energy solutions.<p>
